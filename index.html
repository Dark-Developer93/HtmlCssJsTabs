            Cat fur is the new black hiss and stare at nothing then run suddenly away. Eat prawns daintily with a claw then lick paws clean wash down prawns with a lap of carnation milk then retire to the warmest spot on the couch to claw at the fabric before taking a catnap destroy the blinds, kitty scratches couch bad kitty.

Cough furball tuxedo cats always looking dapper so weigh eight pounds but take up a full-size bed give attitude, or miaow then turn around and show you my bum catasstrophe. Leave fur on owners clothes stand with legs in litter box.
